Summary: GStreamer streaming media framework runtime
Description: |
  GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters which
  operate on media data. Applications using this library can do anything
  from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything
  else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new data
  types or processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new 
  plugins.
